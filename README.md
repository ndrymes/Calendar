# Project Structure

![file structure](https://ibb.co/ph626D4)

# Libraries Used

- Mocha - For running unit tests
- Restidy - Popular framework with a lean set of features for running apps
- Jest - For testing purpose

# Todo

I had a lot of fun building this. There are some improvements I can make:

- More tests, especially  unit tests for all other services and integration using super test.
- Add a dependency injection library like awilix to handle injection of dependencies
- Include a makefile to ease the execution of some common tasks

# Testing

- To run the tests, simply type `npm test`
- We can also get code coverage by `npm run coverage`
